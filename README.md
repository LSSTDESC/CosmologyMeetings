# CosmologyMeetings
Community-maintained listing and calendar of cosmology conference, workshops and collaboration meetings.

This is an experimental project: to help out (eg with maintaining the Google calendar), please contact [Phil Marshall](pjm@stanford.edu) or [open an issue](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CosmologyMeetings/issues).

## Calendar

The above frame shows the public Cosmology Meetings calendar, whose ical address is [https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/a6aumk8bjbhhb9aaa6hg60f19c%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/a6aumk8bjbhhb9aaa6hg60f19c%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)

## Event List

This is under development - the idea is to scrape the calendar to make an automatically-updated, searchable, time-ordered listing. To let everyone know about an upcoming cosmology meeting, please [open an issue](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CosmologyMeetings/issues).
