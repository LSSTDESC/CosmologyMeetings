Good sources of information regarding upcoming meetings include the following pages. Please note the edit mechanisms: as well as calendaring cosmology meetings in this repo, we should help keep the sources up to date: 
- [The CADC astronomy meetings page](http://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/en/meetings/index.html), submit new meetings [here](http://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/en/meetings/editMeetings.html?action=new&title=Submit%20New%20Meeting).
- [COMS Conference Management System](https://www.conference-service.com/conferences/gravitation-and-cosmology.html), submit new meetings [here](https://www.conference-service.com/auxiliary/submit.html).
- [INSPIRE conference search](http://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&cc=Conferences&p=Cosmology&action_search=Search&sf=conferencestartdate&so=d), submit new meetings [here](http://inspirehep.net/submit?doctype=CONFSUBMIT&act=SBI&comboCONFSUBMIT=CONF)


# [Event List](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CosmologyMeetings/blob/auto/EVENTS.md)

The time-ordered and hyper-linked event list linked to above is automatically generated from the calendar on a daily basis, using the notebook [here](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CosmologyMeetings/blob/master/MakeEventList.ipynb) and the travis-ci configuration [here](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CosmologyMeetings/blob/master/.travis.yml). The events list itself is not to be edited: the calendar is the primary source. Issues and pull requests regarding the way the event list is made are welcome on the repo [here](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CosmologyMeetings).
