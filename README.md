# Event List

This is under development - the idea is to scrape the calendar to make an automatically-updated, searchable, time-ordered listing. To let everyone know about an upcoming cosmology meeting, please [open an issue](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CosmologyMeetings/issues). Good sources of information regarding upcoming meetings include: [the CADC astronomy meetings page](http://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/en/meetings/index.html).
